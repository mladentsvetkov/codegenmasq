# VS Code Plugin for removing sensitive data from snippets before pasting them in code generators

## To access the settings for the extension, you can do the following:

Open Visual Studio Code
Press Ctrl + , to open the settings.
In the search bar at the top, type codegenmasq.
Under the "Extensions" section, you should see your extension's settings appear. Here you will be able to modify the codegenmasq.replacements configuration.
By default, changes are made to your user settings, which apply globally to any instance of VS Code you open. However, you can also modify workspace settings, which will only apply to the project you're currently working on. You can toggle between user and workspace settings near the top of the settings tab.
